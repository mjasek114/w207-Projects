    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "a.  Nearest neighbor does not work well for this problem because the distance between two feature vectors is not a good representation that they are in the same class.  Many of the feature vectors have a lot of 0s in them.  If two feature vectors do not have any words in common then, their distance will be 0.  There will be a lot of 0 distances with nearest neighbors.  Nearest neighbors would not work well with sparse data.\n",
    "\n",
    "b.  Logistic regression does not have enough data to compute its parameters.  There are about 25,000 (size of vocab) parameters for it to compute only about 2000 training examples for it to use to calculate the results.  It needs more training data for more accurate results.  Naive Bayes does not have this issue.  The probabilities that it comes up with are from counting, so the probabilities that it comes up with will be accurate.  Also, I read on the internet that logistic regression will always out perform Naive Bayes given enough data.\n",
    "\n",
    "c.  As the value of C gets bigger, the Sum of Squared Weights gets bigger.  The smaller the value of C, the stronger the regularization.  As regularization gets stronger, more features with large weights get eliminated.  The small values of C will eliminate features with large weights, so the sum of their squared weights will be smaller.  The larger values of C will keep more features with larger weights, so the sume of their squared weights will be larger."

    "ANSWER: Comparing Table 1 (only the 1-grams) with Table 2 (1-grams and 2-grams), the features with the highest weights are very similar.  Comparing Table 1 with Table 3 (2-grams ONLY), the features with the highest weights have very little overlap.  In Table 3, the features with the highest weights start to include small, common words like 'the', 'is' and 'in' and in general have fewer words or phrases that stand out as examples for a particular class.  The weights in Tables 2 and 3 are lower in general than the weights in Table 1.  For each largest features, the weights from the classes for which the feature was not the largest mostly have negative weights for this feature. "

    "(5) Try to improve the logistic regression classifier by passing a custom preprocessor to CountVectorizer. The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular. With your new preprocessor, how much did you reduce the size of the dictionary?\n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a plot showing accuracy of the re-trained model vs. the vocabulary size you get when pruning unused features by adjusting the C parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.01 (the default is .0001).\n",

    "ANSWER: TfidfVectorizer is different from CountVectorizer because the TfidfVectorizer does some additional scaling. It scales down the impact of terms that occur in a lot of documents in the group of documents.  It does this by adding a term called TF*IDF to the raw term frequencies.  TF = term frequency and IDF = inverse document frequency.  The multiplication by the IDF term (or division by DF = document frequency) is what scales down the impact of the terms that occur in many documents.  It seems to be making mistakes on documents that do not contain a lot of topic-specific words like.  It's possible that the really frequent topic specific words are being scaled down too much because they appear in a lot of documents within their own topic.  One way to fix this after you do the TF-IDF scaling, you could take the highest of the remaining frequencies and scale them up a little bit.  Also, these examples that it is getting wrong seem really difficult to classify.  I'm not sure using the regular CountVectorizer would get them right either.  The first example has references to Mormon, but also to computer words like Microsoft, ASCII and LaTeX.  I'm not sure how either system would classify it correctly.  Also, the examples that it got wrong are either really short or really long.  It's possible that the fact that IDF works on a document-only basis may disproportionately affect shorter or longer documents."
